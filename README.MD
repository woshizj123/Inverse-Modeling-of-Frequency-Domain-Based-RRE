Mulit-layer Inverse Model of Frequency Domain-Based One-Dimensional Soil Water Flow

main functions:
fresolution: Mulit-layer solutions for period flux propagation in soil.
steadysolution: Mulit-layer solutions for steady  soil moister propagation in soil.
grad_sensitivity: The gradient method is used to calculate the cross-covariance matrix of Ks for amplitude and phase difference
inverse_steady: Steady  soil moister inversion Ks module
inverse_amp: Amplitude inversion Ks module
inverse_ps: Phase shift inversion Ks module
inverse_scheme1: case 1
inverse_scheme2: case 2
DR_split_line: Determine effective observed depth, the Damping Ratio (DR = 20), which is defined as the ratio of amplitude to that at the soil surface
cor.lay: Plot program (tecplot), using a1, a2,a3,b1,b2,b3,pp(DR_split_line)

folder:
inverse_VG:
